## Matrices and Local Space transforms
- can be can be 2x2 or 3x3 or 4x4 matrix

## Identity Matrix (also called unit matrix)
- type of matrix that
- if you a shape multiply by this matrix it will remain the same shape, equilivent of multiplying by 1.
- it outputs the input postions
- example:
- the diagional line OF 1'S indicates this is an Identity Matrix  
  1 0 0 0  
  0 1 0 0  
  0 0 1 0  
  0 0 0 1  

- a 3x3 matrix is called a Rotation Matrix
- the x's in this 3x3 matrix define the rotation  
- the T's define the translation
